# LinkedIn Analysis for the RLEs
How is LinkedIn being used by Companies and Employees?

There is always a difference between the headcount size registered by the companies and the actual number of people registered by the employee or the associated members on themselves to the companies on LinkedIn. If the difference is in the reliable difference range, the companies can be considered reliable LinkedIn entities(RLE). This set of codes is for analysing further characteristics and LinkedIn usability for the RLEs.

This analysis includes these EDA and data visualisations:
* EDA on the difference between the actual headcount and the registered size range
* EDA on the attributes of the RLE companies
* EDA on the LinkedIn usabilities of the RLE companies
* Correlation between LinkedIn usabilities and their followers
* Correlation between LinkedIn usabilities and their headcounts
* Correlation between their followers and their headcounts
